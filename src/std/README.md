# Cap'n Proto Standard Library Files

These files are the underpinning of much of the RPC and code generation portions of the library.

They were copied directly from https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/tree/41264ae6deb85ee9d9756e88293c856f7e9fe9d9/c%2B%2B/src/capnp.

The files are generated by hand in order to bootstrap compiler development. They is intended to be an exact match to compiled output.
